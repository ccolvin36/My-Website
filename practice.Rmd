I am currently a member of the Blanchard Lab with a focus on Acidobaceria. We are currently focusing on changes in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data found in samples of Acidobacteria as a result of soil warming. My current research interests include changes in the soil microbiome as a result of Global Warming along with human genomics.
